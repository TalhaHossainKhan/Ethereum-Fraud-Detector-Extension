# Overview

As an associate at the Youth Policy Forum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, I had the unique opportunity to delve into the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. My role involved extensive research and collaboration with lawmakers, exploring the potential integration of these innovative technologies into Bangladesh's financial landscape.

During this journey, I encountered a sobering reality: the prevalence of fraud within the crypto space. It became clear that while blockchain technology offers immense potential, it also presents significant risks to unsuspecting users. This realization sparked a personal mission to contribute to a safer crypto environment.

That's where this Ethereum Fraud Detector Extension comes in. This project aims to provide a layer of security for Ethereum users. By leveraging machine learning, the extension helps identify potentially fraudulent activities, empowering users to make informed decisions about their transactions.
