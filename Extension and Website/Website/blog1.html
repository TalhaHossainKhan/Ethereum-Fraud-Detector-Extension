                Cryptocurrency often has negative connotations of fraud and scams. Yet, the benefits are repeatedly looked down upon. Despite the perspectives on cryptocurrency, its implementation in Bangladesh comes with challenges and risks which need to be carefully managed and assessed. <br> <br>

                A substantial portion of the Bangladesh population lacks access to traditional banking services. This is partly due to high service charges, leaving rural Bangladesh disenfranchised. Financial exclusion leads to higher poverty rates and increases the wealth gap in Bangladesh. However, cryptocurrency offers an opportunity for the rural population to engage in financial transactions. Using cryptocurrency can significantly reduce the cost and time associated with financial transactions. This is due to the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrency and its decentralised nature. The absence of middlemen and third parties greatly reduces paperwork and errors when verifying transactions. Hence reducing overhead costs as well. Reduced costs also allow the sending and receiving of remittances to be more efficient which is pivotal for the Bangladesh economy as it accounts for 5.3% of GDP in 2021. <br> <br>
                
                Blockchain technology offers both transparency and immutability. Therefore, cryptocurrency-backed transactions can help reduce corruption in Bangladesh by making it more challenging for officials to siphon off funds or manipulate financial records. Moreover, smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the agreement written directly into the code, can further enhance transparency. This removes the need for any intermediary to make transactions. <br> <br>
                
                During times of crisis, such as natural disasters, cryptocurrency can be a quick and efficient way to send aid to certain areas in need. Donors can send funds without any delays associated with traditional banking channels. A low-lying country like Bangladesh is very vulnerable to floods which means a more efficient financial system must be in place to help those in times of need. As mentioned before, cryptocurrency-backed transactions are transparent which prevents money from donations and aid from going to the pockets of those in charge.<br> <br>
                
                With all that being said, letâ€™s look into the challenges and risks of implementing cryptocurrency in Bangladesh. <br> <br>
                
                As of today, cryptocurrency is banned in Bangladesh due to its concerns. One of which being volatility. This can be a double-edged sword as it can lead to massive gains but also lead to massive losses as well. Additionally, the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies means individuals are responsible for their own wallets and security. Thus, without proper education, users can fall victim to scams and hacks. With a financial literacy rate of 28%, educating the masses about cryptocurrency is an issue in itself. <br> <br>
                
                To address the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the Bangladesh government could create a crypto coin backed by Bangladesh taka (BDT) which is similar to USDC (a crypto coin backed by USD). In addition, a widespread awareness program is required to educate the public on its use and potential issues with it such as scams and fraud. <br> <br>
                
                To conclude, initiating this project will require a lot of research, caution and funds. With Bangladesh currently struggling to make ends meet it is highly unlikely a project of this sort to gain momentum soon. However, with cryptocurrency evolving due to technological advancement, it would not take time for the Bangladesh government to take notice. <br> <br>
